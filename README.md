- 👋 Hi, I’m @sixtusg
- 👀 I’m interested in living, laughing and loving.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go and getting by on a day to day basis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things which I am capable of collaborating on; I am a junior programmer and likely won't be of much assistance.
- 📫 I can be reached at `sgx6#1210` on Discord. This will probably not be updated when my username or tag changes, because I probably won't remember.
